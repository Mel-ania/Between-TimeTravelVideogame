Between is a platform puzzle time travel based videogame. The goal is to escape techno-magical alien rooms connected by portals.

The player can move between a precise time point in the past and the present. If he moves something in the past, then he creates an alternate present, because of the space-time paradox. Due to that, there will be multiple alternative time lines which will influence the player's journey.

<sub>Technologies: Unity, C#, Visual Studio, Adobe Photoshop</sub>

This is the first version, aka demo, with only three levels.

Please, note that the player can:
- run pressing right and left arrows;
- jump pressing space;
- time travel pressing "T" when owning a key.
