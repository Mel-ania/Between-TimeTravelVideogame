Between is a platform puzzle time travel based videogame. The player can move between a precise time point in the past and the present. If he moves something in the past, then he creates an alternate present, because of the space-time paradox.
This is the first version, aka demo, with only three levels.
Please, note that the player can:
- run pressing right and left arrows;
- jump pressing space;
- time travel pressing "T" when owning a key.
